## Outline of Project ##
This repositry contains a 3 week project

## How to run the file ##
to run the algorithm for a given dataset, simply change the dataset that is read in on line 9 to the desired text file and the trainlength on line 12 to the desired number and run the code. The confusion matrix variable is what is outputted.

## Description of the file structure ##

The datasets are:
 * iris.txt
 * ionosphere.txt
 * USPS.txt
 * USPSsubset.txt
 
The knn algorithm can be run by running nn.R by specifying the desired dataset that will be used within the nn.R file itself as specified above.

## Library Required: ##
* class (to run the built in knn function in R to compare results with my code)
<p>

## Examples ##
An example of how to run the code is included in nn.R for the ionosphere dataset.
